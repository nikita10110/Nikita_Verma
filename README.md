## [Project1: Face Recognition using LBPHF Recognizer](https://github.com/nikita10110/ml_projects/tree/master/face_recogniton_using_LBPH)
For this project I have build a *Face recognizer using LBPHF* to identify the face in the image. This could be useful for the person in different fields. For example if we train our model on the dataset of company employee and when we give an image and try to recognize the person if he\she company employee or not. This is underlying model for building something with capabilities.


To detect an face from the image, I have applied *Haar Cascade model*. Once the faces are detected. Further, i have applied face recognition using the *local Binary Pattern Histogram Face Recognizer*.

I am able to get the model to predict with 90% accuray after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the requirement.
