## [Project1: Face Recognition using LBPHF Recognizer](https://github.com/nikita10110/ml_projects/tree/master/face_recogniton_using_LBPH)
For this project I have build a *Face recognizer using LBPHF* to identify the face in the image. This could be useful for the person in different fields. For example if we train our model on the dataset of company employee and when we give an image and try to recognize the person if he\she company employee or not. This is underlying model for building something with capabilities.


To detect an face from the image, I have applied *Haar Cascade model*. Once the faces are detected. Further, i have applied face recognition using the *local Binary Pattern Histogram Face Recognizer*.

I am able to get the model to predict with 90% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the requirement.

## [Project2: Face Recognition using Facenet](https://github.com/nikita10110/ml_projects/tree/master/face_recognition_using_facenet)
For this Project I have build a *Face recogniton using Facent* to recognize the person in the image. For the model i have used the *inceptionresent network* which is pretrained on vgg-16 dataset. I have performed some hypertuning like removing the end layers, adding the layers according to the rquirements, hypertuning learning rate.
  
I am able to get the model to predict with an accuracy of 90% after minimal tuning.

## [Project 3: Sentiment analysis using LSTM](https://github.com/nikita10110/sentimentanalysis)
- Used the *Kaggle IMBN movies reviews dataset*.
- Performed tokeniztion on the data.
- Performed some cleaning like removing stopwords.
- Trained the data on the LSTM model.



I am  able to get the model to predict the sentiment of the review whether it is a positive or negative.

## [Project 4: Password Strength analysis](https://github.com/nikita10110/password_strength_nlp)
For this project I have used the dataset that contains various password which are of different strength. This model can used in different fields example while registering where we required to create a account and set password. We can use it to determine whether the password is of weak, strong, medium strength. So that the account password cannot be cracked and is *safe* .

I am able to get the model to predict the strength of the password. 

## Experience
### [1. Data Science intern at cureya](https://www.cureya.in/)
*june23,2021- july27,2021*

In the internship, I have worked on different project. The final project was to develop *Disease Predictor* an api using Machine Learning and Data Science. My part of work  was to develop the back hand part where using the five symptoms that user entered to predict the diease the person may be suffering. For the purpose i  have used the various machine learning algorithms to determine the disease the person  may be suffering.
